      <p>But first:</p>
      <p>This is a random feature that says "Hello world" in 4 languages:<p> 
      <button onclick="addRandomGreeting()">Hello</button>
      <p id="greetingContainer"></p>
      <p>Why is that feature here? Je ne sais pas.</p>

        <h2>Projects I have been involved in</h2>
        <p>Listed below are the projects I have been involed in: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Research with Dr. Zoe Boekelheide</li>
            <li>Rideshare App Network</li>
            <li>Restaurant Simulator</li>
            <li>Random Maze Generator</li>
            <li>Miner Tycoon</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Research with Dr. Zoe Boekelheide</h2>
        <p>This project involves developing data acquisition and organization tools
            for Dr. Zoe Boekelheide's condensed matter research laboratory in Lafayette College.
            I was involved in developing central remote control programs for all devices and
            recording instruments in the lab, creating data piplelines to feed into analytic programs
            and creating GUIs to help send instructions using few buttons instead of interacting with
            computer code.

        frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" 
        allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>This is my first ever CS project and I am proud to still be working on it :)</p>
        <h3>Rideshare App Network</h3>
        <p>This was my third project in Data Structures and Algorithms class in Fall 2019.
            It involved using graphs to simulate a rideshare network tracking data like:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Average trip time during normal and busy hours</li>
            <li>Average number of customers per driver per day</li>
            <li>Number of drivers utilized</li>
            <li>Number of passengers lost</li>
            <li>Average wait-time of passengers in normal and busy hours</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This project involved using primary uses Djikstra's algoritm to calculate shortest path
            with a changing traffic network environment.
        </p>
        <h3>Restaurant Simulator</h3>
        <div class = "images">
            <a href = "images/projects/restaurant0.png"><img src = "images/projects/restaurant0.png"></a>
            <a href = "images/projects/restaurant1.png"><img src = "images/projects/restaurant1.png"></a>
            <a href = "images/projects/restaurant2.png"><img src = "images/projects/restaurant2.png"></a>
            <a href = "images/projects/restaurant3.png"><img src = "images/projects/restaurant3.png"></a>
        </div>
        <p>This was my first project in Data Structures and Algorithms class in Fall 2019.
            It involved using linked lists and queues to simulate the operation of an eatery
            on Lafayette College giving data such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Average customers in normal and busy hours</li>
            <li>Profitability of the eatery</li>
            <li>Staff utilization</li>
            <li>Revenue and cost of operation</li>
            <li>Satisfaction of customers</li>
            <li>Average wait-times of customers in normal and busy periods</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Random Maze Generator</h3>
        <p>This project involved creating a graphical representation of mazes used in the
            <a href = "https://ieeetv.ieee.org/conference-highlights/micromouse">IEEE Micromouse competition</a>
            . This makes it easy for engineers to focus on developing and
            improving their mice while this tool creates random maps instantly when necessary
            for testing.
        </p>
        <div class = "images">
            <a href = "images/projects/maze.png"><img src = "images/projects/maze.png"></a>
        </div>
        <p>This random maze generator is built in such a way that every cell is accessible from any other cell
            which is not exactly a requirement for IEEE Micromouse competition. This creates a chance for the
            mice to truly find the shortest path out of the maximum number of possibilities.
        </p>
        <h3>Miner Tycoon</h3>

        <div class = "images">
            <a href = "images/projects/miner.png"><img src = "images/projects/miner.png"></a>
        </div>
        <p>This is the second project for my Data Structures and Algorithms class of Fall 2019.
            This involved creating a game simulation with the user as the manager of a mine with
            workers with different abilities on a rectangular map digging for gold while trying to
            avoid hazards like lava, pits/sinkholes and underground rivers.
